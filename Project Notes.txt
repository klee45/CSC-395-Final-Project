	Part-of-Speech Assignment
        Finding part of speech is important for both finding pronunciation
            ('the wind is strong'  vs  'I need to wind my watch')
            In addition, what words are stressed is important
            
    
    A method proposed by Mark Y Liberman and Kenneth W Church from 1992
    utilized both the lexical probabilities and contextual probabilities
    when calculating the overall likely part of speech for a given word
    in a sentence.
